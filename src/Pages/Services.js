                    <p className='mt-34 font-size-34 font-bold-200 text-justify'>‘Abhayanga’ which translates to ‘Oil Massage’ in Sanskrit, is a holistic practice that aims to restore harmony and balance to the body’s energy centers, known as doshas. During the massage, warm oil is generously applied to the entire body using long, flowing strokes that follow the natural flow of energy channels.</p>
                    <p className='mt-40 font-size-34 font-bold-200 text-justify'>Special attention is paid to key energy points, joints, and areas of tension to encourage the release of blockages and promote the free flow of vital energy, or prana.</p>

                    <h3 className='font-gold font-size-46 font-bold-500 font-family-petrona'>Body Massage offers a wide range of physical, mental, and emotional benefits. Here are some of the key benefits;</h3>

                    <p className='mt-40 font-size-34 font-bold-200 text-justify'>1. <span className='font-bold-400'>Relaxation:</span> Massage promotes relaxation by reducing muscle tension and releasing endorphins, which are natural mood elevators. This can help alleviate stress and anxiety.</p>
                    <p className='mt-60 font-size-34 font-bold-200 text-justify'>2. <span className='font-bold-400'>Pain Relief:</span> Massage therapy can help alleviate various types of pain, including chronic pain, tension headaches, and muscle soreness. It can also improve flexibility and range of motion, reducing the risk of injuries.</p>
                    <p className='mt-60 font-size-34 font-bold-200 text-justify'>3. <span className='font-bold-400'>Improved Circulation:</span> Massage techniques help stimulate blood flow to the tissues, which improves circulation. Better circulation can lead to enhanced delivery of oxygen and nutrients to the cells and improved removal of waste products from the body.</p>
                    <p className='mt-60 font-size-34 font-bold-200 text-justify'>4. <span className='font-bold-400'>Muscle Recovery:</span> Massage can aid in muscle recovery after intense physical activity or injury by reducing inflammation, promoting tissue repair, and relieving muscle stiffness and soreness.</p>
                    <p className='mt-60 font-size-34 font-bold-200 text-justify'>5. <span className='font-bold-400'>Enhanced Immunity:</span> Regular massage therapy has been linked to a stronger immune system. It can help increase the production of white blood cells, which play a crucial role in defending the body against infections and illnesses.</p>
                    <p className='mt-60 font-size-34 font-bold-200 text-justify'>6. <span className='font-bold-400'>Better Sleep:</span> Massage promotes relaxation and reduces stress hormones, which can lead to better sleep quality. Improved sleep can contribute to overall health and well-being.</p>
                    <p className='mt-60 font-size-34 font-bold-200 text-justify'>7. <span className='font-bold-400'>Mental Well-being:</span> Massage therapy has been shown to reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety, as well as improve mood and overall mental health. The release of endorphins during massage contributes to these positive effects.</p>
                    <p className='mt-60 font-size-34 font-bold-200 text-justify'>8. <span className='font-bold-400'>Improved Skin Health:</span> Certain massage techniques, such as exfoliation and moisturizing, can improve skin texture, tone, and hydration. Additionally, increased blood flow to the skin can promote a healthy, radiant complexion.</p>
                    <p className='mt-60 font-size-34 font-bold-200 text-justify'>9. <span className='font-bold-400'>Detoxification:</span> Massage stimulates the lymphatic system, which helps remove toxins and waste products from the body. This detoxifying effect can contribute to overall health and vitality.</p>
                    <p className='mt-60 font-size-34 font-bold-200 text-justify'>Overall, regular body massage can be a valuable part of a holistic approach to health and wellness, promoting physical relaxation, mental tranquillity, and emotional balance.</p>
